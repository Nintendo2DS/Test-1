    <h3>For this project, I have chosen to use a Windows Azure License. I chose this because my other option Amazon AWS was a little more complex to navigate and use. While Windows Azure for myself felt more streamlined, organized, and easier to use. And since the pricing between the two Infrastructures, and service options were very similar, I decided to just use the option that I felt more comfortable using. Another justification for my picking Azure is how it's part of the Microsoft ecosystem, making it easier to use other Microsoft products with it.
